## Machine Learning
### Context-Free Grammars

A *context-free grammar (CFG)* is a set of recursive writing rules (or **productions**) used to generate patterns of strings.

A CFG consists of the following components:
- A set of **terminal symbols**, which are the characters of the alphabet that appear in the strings generated by the grammar.
- A set of **nonterminal symbols**, which are placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols that can be generated by the nonterminal symbols.
- A set of **productions**, which are rules for replacing (or rewriting) nonterminal symbols (on the left side of the production) in a string with other nonterminal or terminal symbols (on the right side of the production).
- A **start symbol**, which is a special nonterminal symbol that appears in the intial string generated by the grammar.

To generate a string of terminal symbols from a CFG, we:
- Begin with a string consisting of the start symbol.
- Apply one of the productions with the start symbol on the left hand size, replacing the start symbol with the right hand sidde of the production.
- Repeat the process of selecting nonterminal symbols in the string,and replacing them with the right hand side of some corresponding production, until all nonterminals have been replaced by terminal symbols.

### Pytorch
Pytorch differs from Tensorflow and Caffe etc. due to the unique way it builds its neural networks. Other machine learning frameworks use a **static** method, where one has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again. This is called **Define and Run**, which means that if you want to change how the network behaves you must start from scratch again.

Pytorch instead uses a technique called *reverse-mode auto differentiation*, which allows you to change the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. This means that it has a **dynamic** method of building its graph of the network, where the graph is built on the fly. This **Define by Run"** capability allows for more flexiblity and is why Pytorch is becoming more dominant in research applications.
