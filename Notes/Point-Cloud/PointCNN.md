# Contributions
## Problem addressed / Motivation
- Point cloud data is irregular and unordered, convolution operations are ill-suited for leveraging spatially-local correlations in the data.

## Idea / Observation / Contribution
- Propose to learn an X-transform from the input points to simultaneously promote two causes:
  - The weighting of the input features associated with the points.
  - The permutation of the points into a latent and potentially canonical order.
