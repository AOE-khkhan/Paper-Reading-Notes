## Problem addressed / Motivation
- Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train.
- The vanishing/exploding gradient problem is where as the gradient is back-propagated to earlier layers, repeated multiplication may make the gradient infinitesimally small.
- However, a **degradation** problem has been exposed, where with increasing network depth, the accuracy gets saturated and then degrades rapidly.
